Hello, my name is Eduardo Bauer and I am an intern at the city hall in my city. During the days I realized that creating elderly and PNE credentials was very costly in terms of time and manual, so I decided to do this project, where I already insert the new credential into the dataframe, in this case is the excel, and already generates your own credential in word and in the end printing them.
